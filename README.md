# Dataset

In this project, time series classification is used to predict the pattern of user movements in real-world office environments. 

This problem involves determining whether or not an individual has moved between rooms based on time series of radio signal strength (RSS) between nodes of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN).

The dataset was collected and made available by researchers from the University of Pisa in Italy. It is described in their paper [An experimental characterization of reservoir computing in ambient assisted living applications](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-013-1364-4).
