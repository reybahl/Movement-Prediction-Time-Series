In this method, features are extracted using the `tsfresh` Python package. A comprehensive feature set is first created, then the unimportant features are removed, and several machine learning models are trained on the final data.

Model Results (to be updated here):
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Logistic Regression
* Ensemble Voting Classifier
